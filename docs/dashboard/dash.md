# Dash

![Pairwise sample](/img/dash1.png)

The dashboard at the top serves as a ***dynamic hub***, offering a snapshot of critical insights derived from the dataframe. With its intuitive layout, it provides at-a-glance access to key metrics, trends, and patterns, empowering users to make informed decisions swiftly.

The layout is highly intuitive; the ***donut charts***  represent missing, duplicate, and constant values as percentages, providing a clear understanding of their prevalence.

Meanwhile, the horizontal ***bar chart***  illustrates the count of specific variables, offering a tangible sense of their frequency within the dataset.
